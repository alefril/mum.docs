# MUM Documentation

MUM uses [Jigsaw](http://jigsaw.tighten.co/) as a static site generator for the documentation.
To build the static site yourself, you will need the following tools:

- PHP 7
- Composer
- Node.js + NPM

If you have installed all dependencies, build and view the site with:

```bash
npm run production
./vendor/bin/jigsaw serve
```
